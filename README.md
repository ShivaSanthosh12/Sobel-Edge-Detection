# Sobel Edge Operator

This project focuses on implementing a Sobel edge detection processor on an FPGA using Verilog hardware description language (HDL). Sobel edge detection is a widely used method in image processing for identifying edges within images. By applying convolution operations with specific kernels, Sobel edge detection effectively highlights areas of significant intensity changes, indicating the presence of edges.

The project aims to create a dedicated hardware accelerator for Sobel edge detection, capable of efficiently processing image data to identify edges in real-time. By deploying this processor on an FPGA, it can be integrated into various image processing systems, such as surveillance cameras, medical imaging devices, and autonomous vehicles, enhancing their ability to detect and interpret visual information effectively.
